# MAI_Lab
Laboratory works that I'm doing for Moscow Aviation Institute. 

Discipline: principles of design of robotic systems.

For now, there are a list of connected realisations:

1. Linear Algebra (vector and matrix calculations)
2. The Dorman-Prince integration method of order 4(5)
3. Realisations of main laws of dynamic (pendulums)
4. Quaternion Algebra (with supplemented Matrix classes)
5. Solar Watch simulation

N.B. 
All comments in repo done in russian. GitHub couldn't explain some of them correctly, because of incorrect encoding thanks to Visual Studio.
