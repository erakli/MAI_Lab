# MAI_Lab
Laboratory works that I'm doing for Moscow Aviation Institute. 

Discipline: principles of design of robotic systems.

For now, there are 4 connected realisations:

1. Linear Algebra (vector and matrix calculations)
2. The Dorman-Prince integration method of order 4(5)
3. Realisations of main laws of dynamic (pendulums)
4. Quaternion Algebra (with supplemented Matrix classes)

N.B. 
All comments in repo done in russian. GitHub couldn't explain them correctly, I don't know why. In this case, if you want to read my comments in code (in the same way if you understand russian or not) you can clone repo or use "Download ZIP" link on the right.
